# Landing-Page Project

For this project, I wanted to give my personal touch and not just aim for the exact result I was asking for. This approach allowed me to challenge myself and better understand the ideas behind flexbox and how it works, especially the importance of structuring HTML to get all the flexbox content layouts perfectly. Flexbox is a powerful tool if used well. This project also gave me the opportunity to use my skills as a graphic designer. I can't wait to learn how to integrate my 3D skills into the coding world!

I aimed to create a simple landing page for a fictitious crypto trading company called AGORA.

This project gave me a little introduction to the world of JavaScript functions. I had some ideas to make sections of the landing page dynamic, so all the JavaScript parts mentioned below were created thanks to hours of research, tweaking and testing (StackOverflow, etc.) to get the desired outcome I was looking for:

- Dynamic Price Updates with specific ranges to each coin: Real-time updates with subsequent updates every minute for cryptocurrency prices and percentages.
    
    * BTC ranges between $10,000 and $99,999.

    * ADA, DOGE, FTM range between $0.1 and $1.

    * XRP, BNB, ETH range between $1000 and $9999.

    * NEWCOIN ranges between $0.0000001 and $0.000001.

Note: The crypto prices and percentages are fictional and not reflective of real market values.

- Content Toggle: Buttons for "Popular" and "New Listing" to switch between content sections.

- Hero Section Animation: Hero section fades in from the left when the page loads.

- Key Features section: Smooth and Dynamic Hover Animation that enhance user interactivity.


Due to my current knowledge limitations in responsive design, the landing page behaves well only in 1080p and iPad displays. I plan to update this project to be fully responsive as soon as I tackle responsive design in future lessons.
